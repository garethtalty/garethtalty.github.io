  Hi, my name's Gareth and I'm a Software Engineer.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>JavaScript</mark> and <mark>React</mark>.

  As a keen technologist and agile advocate, I have built enterprise software across industries and played an active role in growing an early stage start-up into a well established scale-up. The perfect role is one that encourages strong collaboration with others to create scalable and robust software.

  I enjoy what I do, and take real pride in building things that look great and work well.
